# OffensiveZig

The purpose of this project is to do some experiments with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) to explore the possibility of using it for implant development and general offensive operations. it is inspired from [@byt3bl33d3r](https://twitter.com/byt3bl33d3r)'s project "[OffensiveNim](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/OffensiveNim)".

## Why Zig?

- Zig's backend using LLVM and also can be as a C compiler, Nim can use it to compile. [ [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_(programming_language)) ]
- The feature about generation of human-readable C code may be supported in the future. [ [issue #3772](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/3772) ] 
- Zig doesn't rely on a VM/runtime, the static executable is super small.
- Rust inspired syntax, allows rapid native payload creation & prototyping.
- Integration with C libraries without FFI/bindings.
- Manual memory management, no hidden control flow.
- Its very easy to do cross-compile things and can build for any of the targets from [here](https://ziglang.org/#Support-Table), no "cross toolchain" needs to be installed or anything like that.
- To Learn `zig zen`: together we serve the users.

## Try to Learn Zig in Y minutes

Nim tutorials are available at [Learn X in Y Minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nim/) and it also has a [Book](https://livebook.manning.com/book/nim-in-action) named *Nim in Action*, but Zig dont't. You can find lots of content referenced from https://ziglearn.org & Zig's main developer youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUICU6mgcyGy61pojwuWyHA* 

## How to play

**Examples in this project**

| File | Description |
| ---  | --- |
| `pop_bin.zig` | Call `MessageBox` WinApi *without* using the 3rd-party library |
| `pop_zigwin32_bin.zig` | Call `MessageBox` *with* the [Zig-win32](https://github.com/GoNZooo/zig-win32) libary |
| `pop_zigwin32_lib.zig` | Example of creating a Windows DLL with an exported `DllMain` |  
| `wmiquery_bin.zig` | Queries running processes and installed AVs using using WMI |
| `shellcode_bin.zig` | Creates a suspended process and injects shellcode with `VirtualAllocEx`/`CreateRemoteThread`. Also demonstrates the usage of compile time definitions to detect arch, os etc..| 
| `http_request_bin.zig` | Demonstrates a couple of ways of making HTTP requests |

I recommand [install zig from a Package Manager](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Install-Zig-from-a-Package-Manager). Some of the examples in this project use third-party libraries, unfortunately Zig does not provide official package management at the moment, You need to follow the README.md for using of the third library, or use a package management tool that is in the prototype stage called [zkg](https://github.com/mattnite/zkg). 

## Cross Compiling

See the cross-compilation section in the [Zig compiler usage guide](https://ziglang.org/#Cross-compiling-is-a-first-class-use-case), for a lot more details.

Cross compiling to Windows from MacOs/Nix: `zig build-exe -target x86_64-windows src.zig`

## Interfacing with C/C++

See the insane [Integration with C](https://ziglang.org/#Integration-with-C-libraries-without-FFIbindings) section in the Zig document.

Here's `MessageBox` example

```zig
const std = @import("std");
usingnamespace std.os.windows;

extern "user32" fn MessageBoxA(hWnd: ?HANDLE, lpText: ?LPCTSTR, lpCaption: ?LPCTSTR, uType: UINT) callconv(.Stdcall) c_int;

pub fn main() void {
    _ = MessageBoxA(null, "hello,world!", "title", 0);
}
```

## Creating Windows DLLs with an exported `DllMain`

See the insane [Building a library](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Building-a-Library) section.

As you can see, the code in the example is already very close to what C code looks like, just use `export` keyword.

Example:

```zig
const std = @import("std");
const builtin = @import("builtin");

usingnamespace std.os.windows;

extern "user32" fn MessageBoxA(hWnd: ?HANDLE, lpText: ?LPCTSTR, lpCaption: ?LPCTSTR, uType: UINT) c_int;

const DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH = 1;
const DLL_THREAD_ATTACH = 2;
const DLL_THREAD_DETACH = 3;
const DLL_PROCESS_DETACH = 0;

export fn hello(data: *c_void, size: i32) i32 {
    _ = MessageBoxA(null, "hello, Im in Exported Function", "title", 0);
    return 0;
}
pub export fn DllMain(hInstance: HINSTANCE, ul_reason_for_call: DWORD, lpReserved: LPVOID) BOOL {
    switch(ul_reason_for_call) {
        DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH => {
            _ = MessageBoxA(null, "hello, Im in DllMain", "title", 0);
        },
        DLL_THREAD_ATTACH => {},
        DLL_THREAD_DETACH => {},
        DLL_PROCESS_DETACH =>{},
        else => {},
    }
    return 1;
}
```

To compile:

```
//To make a static library
zig build-lib test.zig -target x86_64-windows 
//To make a shared library
zig build-lib test.zig -dynamic -target x86_64-windows 
```

## Optimizing executables for size

Taken from the [Build Mode](https://ziglang.org/documentation/master/#Build-Mode)

For the biggest size decrease use the following flags `--release-small --strip --single-threaded`

a full example for compile windows executable on Macos: `zig build-exe src.zig -O ReleaseSmall --strip --single-threaded -target x86_64-windows`

## Executable size difference when using the 3rd-party windows library vs without

Incredibly enough the size difference is pretty negligible. Especially when you apply the size optimizations outlined above.

Zig has own build system, it provides a cross-platform, dependency-free way to declare the logic required to build a project. use `zig init-exe` command will generate `build.zig` file is automatically. for using 3rd-party lib "[Zig-win32](https://github.com/GoNZooo/zig-win32)", edit your `build.zig`ï¼Œor copy the zig-win32 folder to the root folder your zig source code, Zig cannot import module from the parent folder of src.

The two examples `pop_bin.zig` and `pop_zigwin32_bin.zig` were created for this purpose. lets have a look:

```
% ll
 - rwx r-x r-x  darkray staff 253.50K 25.Nov'20 15:42 >_ pop_bin.exe
 - rwx r-x r-x  darkray staff 253.50K 25.Nov'20 16:18 >_ pop_zigwin32_bin.exe
```

There seems to be no difference in size from the above results.

## Opsec Considerations

All samples are compiled in this mode `zig build-exe src.zig -O ReleaseSmall --strip --single-threaded -target x86_64-windows`

Aside from a few specific NT functions found in the import table, I have not been able to find any other significant features that would indicate that they were coded in Zig.

## Converting C code to Zig

Zig already provides the ability to translate C to Zig code, just try `zig translate-c`

Used it to translate a bunch of small C snippets, I haven't tried using this feature yet.

## Language Bridges

About python module or Java JNI, I have not tried it yet.

## Debugging

Use the function of `std.debug` namespace to show the call stack, and there is no IDE has good support for Zig's Debugging yet. If you use VSCode, try this extension ( `webfreak.debug` ), plz check this link[ [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zig/comments/cl0x6k/debugging_zig_in_vscode/) ][ [2](https://dev.to/watzon/debugging-zig-with-vs-code-44ca) ]for more details.



## Setting up a dev environment

VSCode also provides two extensions ( `tiehuis.zig`  & `lorenzopirro.zig-snippets` ) to support Zig, although the functionality is very limited at this time.

## Comparison of Zig and Nim

|    	 | Zig	 |  Nim  |
|  ----  | ----  | ----  |
| Syntax Styles  | like Rust | like Python |
| Backend  | LLVM or Self-hosted | Others C Compiler or Self-Hosted |
| Code Generate  | Support in future | Supported |
| Standard Library  | General | Numerous |
| Memory Management  | Manual | Multi-paradigm GC |
| FFI | *Directly* | Support |
| Translate C to *ThisLang*  | Official | Third-Party |
| Package Manager  | N/A | Nimble |
| Cross Compile | Convenient | Convenient |
| Executable Size (windows x86 debug mode) | ~200K | ~300K |
| Learning Curve | Not so easy | Easy |
| Community Resources | Poor | Rich |

## Summary

In summary, I wouldn't be willing to use Zig as my primary Offensive language at this timeï¼ŒI've also looked at similar languages, such as [Vlang](https://vlang.io/), but still haven't started trying them out. Nim has better community resources and clearer documentation than Zig, reading the documentation became a pain when trying to get Zig to do the same job. Manual memory management is not very friendly for non-professional developers, so maybe when Zig stabilizes in the future, I'll be more willing to use it for some development work in penetration testing.

*ps: I am not a pro developer, this project is only from the perspective of a penetration testing engineer. The above opinions are my own,  plz correct me if theres any errors :)*
